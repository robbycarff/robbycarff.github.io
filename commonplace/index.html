		<p>"The tradition of the commonplace book contains a central tension between order and chaos, between the desire for methodical arrangment, and the desire for surprising new links of association. For some enlightenment-era advocates, the common place book became an aspirational metaphor for one's own mental life."


		In Steven Johnsons book *Where Good Ideas Come From*, the process of innovation is rigorously decoupled. Early on, the notion that _liquid networks_ and _the adjacent possible_ are intrinsicly tied to innovation is unvield. Johnson methodically walks the reader through the fact that an idea is not a single thing, it is more like a swarm. When the elements of these swarms are able to move freely, to colide, that is when the adjacent possible becomes availible. These liquid networks of culture, history, science, resources, and the present all must be present in order for the seed of inovation to be planted. 


		This collection of material serves as my commonplace - _my liquid network_ - where my ideas have come to swarm and collide. </p>
